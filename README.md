## Running the website on your computer

1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. [Download the code](https://github.com/nfriedly/nodeunblocker.com/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip it
4. Open up a terminal/command line
5. `cd` into the directory
6. Run `npm install` to grab the dependencies.
7. Run `npm start` to start the server. It should spawn a new instance for each CPU core you have.

(Note: running `node app.js` *will not work*. The server code is in the [Gatling](https://npmjs.org/package/gatling)
package, which the `npm start` command calls automatically.)

After that, it will be live on your computer and accessible from your computer at http://localhost:8080/ - accessing it from another computer is beyond the scope of this guide, but it is possible.

## Running the website on Heroku/Bluemix/Azure/AWS/etc

This project should be runnable without modification on a free [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) instance, as well as many other cloud providers. Clone/download the code and deploy it, or just click one of the buttons above.

# About the project

The the core of the nodeunblocker.com has been extracted into a [standalone library](https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker) to make it more flexible, but everything you need to run the website is right here.
